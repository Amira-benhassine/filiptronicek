## About me
I'm a 15-year-old web developer from the Czech Republic, who loves open source. I mainly code in Python and JavaScript, but I am always learning.
I am currently working on a couple of open-source projects, including my own [Interclip](https://github.com/aperta-principium/Interclip), which is a tool that can be used to share links across devices. I also just started contributing to [Open Sauced](https://github.com/open-sauced/open-sauced), which is a site to manage your future open-source contributions.

### What I do
I do Open Source. In fact, I do Open Source so much, that 95% of my work on GitHub is free and open to everyone. I am really passionate about doing web development, it is in my opinion the best combination of logical programming and (sometimes) beautiful design.
